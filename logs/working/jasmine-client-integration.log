** You've set up some data subscriptions with Meteor.publish(), but
** you still have autopublish turned on. Because autopublish is still
** on, your Meteor.publish() calls won't have much effect. All data
** will still be sent to all clients.
**
** Turn off autopublish by removing the autopublish package:
**
**   $ meteor remove autopublish
**
** .. and make sure you have Meteor.publish() and Meteor.subscribe() calls
** for each collection that you want clients to see.
